  <h4>
    NOTICE: Changes are coming that will impact your ability to download and use
    these apps.

      >TL;DR: The apps will be pulled from app stores. I will provide other ways
      for you to access them in other capacities. Read on to understand what's
      going on.</em

  <p>
    In 2024, the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) was unilaterally set into
    motion which requires a number of compliance changes for app stores. The
    most impacting factor is the type of transparency it requires from app
    developers. Unless I agree to the new terms put in effect this year, my apps
    will be removed from app stores. One of these terms reads (paraphrasing) as
    follows:
    <strong
      >"Providers of online platforms... shall ensure that traders can only use
      those online platforms... if, prior to the use of their services... they
      have obtained the following information... the name, address, telephone
      number, and email address of the trader."
    </strong>
    <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2065/oj/eng" target="_blank"
      >(Digital Services Act: Article 30 and Article 31)</a
    >
    Providers are the app stores, and the traders include myself. <br /><br />

    <em
      ><strong
        >This means that in order to distribute my apps, they require my home
        address, phone number, and email address available to the public on the
        app store pages.</strong
      ></em
    >
    An email address I can (and have) provided. I can create a secondary phone
    number. But I cannot in good conscience offer up my home address to the
    world. Not only is it an invasion of privacy, but it is unequivocally
    dangerous. Case and point, I have a family. They are more important to me
    than anything, and their safety is not something I can compromise.

    <br /><br />
    <strong
      >I've come to the difficult decision to not agree to the new terms. My
      apps will be removed from app stores any time between February and April
      2025.</strong
    >

    <br /><br />
    A possible solution may be to discontinue distributing my apps in the EU.
    However, I need to be careful with laws regarding discrimination by nationality. 

    <br /><br />
    However, not all is lost! There are some changes in the oven that will allow
    for you to keep cooking.
  </p>
  <ul class="normal-list">
    <li>
      Because my free apps obviously don't make money, they may be exempt from
      the new rules (I've reached out to the "providers" and they wouldn't offer
      clarification). If only the paid version of my apps are removed from app
      stores, and the free version is allowed to stay (without me accepting the
      DSA terms) then I will consolidate all the features into the free version.
      I will no longer have a small income to pay developer costs, but I will
      maintain them for as long as I can. Donations are always welcome.
    </li>
    <li>
      The apps will be going open source. In order to keep these software tools
      free to everyone, I will be choosing a Copyleft license to keep it that
      way. This may be subject to change. Additionally, signed app builds will
      be available from the repository.
    </li>
    <li>
      Because these are hybrid apps (web tech inside an app package), I will be
      hosting a website version. Yes, much of the same features are in the
      <a href="pizza.devlay.com">original website version</a>. You can choose
      whichever you prefer.
    </li>
    <li>PWA, browser supporting.</li>
    <li>
      F-Droid (FOSS third-party app store for Android) is under consideration. I
      haven't researched this enough to say with assurance, but it could be a
      good option!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>Some pros and cons of the new changes:</p>
  <ul class="normal-list">
    <li>
      Because I will no longer have to dedicate time to cross platform support,
      feature development will be faster.
    </li>
    <li>The in-app timer will be going away.</li>
    <li>
      Recipe sharing and backup will look a little different. It'll likely be
      more inconvenient.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <h2>Thank you!</h2>
  <p>
    I've appreciated every supportive email, feature request, bug report, and
    every download. You've all made this app something special, and I'm grateful
    for how far it's come. It's been a passion project from the beginning, and
    I'm hopeful of its future!
